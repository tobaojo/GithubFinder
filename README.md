# GithubFinder
This is an application I built that reaches out to the github API which can fetch users that have a github account and show their profiles along with the top 5 repos of each account.
I used bootstrap to display the data to the user in a presentable manner.

# Features 
Importing data from an API  
presented in a simple fashion 

# how to use
simply start typing a name of a user and the app will filter down till it finds the user you are searching for.
